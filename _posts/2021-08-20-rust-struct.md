A struct, or structure, is a custom data type that can be used to store a collection of values. The data held inside the struct can be of mixed types. The struct can be used to turn a collection of data types into a more meaningful whole. 


There are 3 structs:
- named fields structs
- tuple structs
- unit structs

We'll start of diving into the fields struct.




You can use impl to implement methods. Regular functions are 'free' functions. Functions in an impl block are associated functions, and they are associated with the type that the block is created for.

Methods can take self by value (self) or by reference (&self).

Struct names follow CamelCase.

### Fields
